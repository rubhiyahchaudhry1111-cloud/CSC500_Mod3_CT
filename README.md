## Part 1 – Meal Total Calculator

This program calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant.
It does the following:

- Prompts the user for the food charge
- Calculates an 18% tip
- Calculates a 7% sales tax
- Stores all values in a Python list
- Uses a loop to print each component
- Outputs the final total

### How to Run:

```bash
python part1_meal_total.py
```

### Example Output:

```
Enter the charge for the food: $50
Food charge: $50.00
Tip (18%): $9.00
Sales Tax (7%): $3.50
Total Price: $62.50
```

## Part 2 – 24-Hour Alarm Clock

This program calculates what time an alarm will go off using 24-hour time.
It works by:

1. Asking the user for the current time (0–23)
2. Asking how many hours to wait
3. Adding the numbers together
4. Using modulo 24 to wrap around the clock
5. Displaying the final alarm time

### How to Run:

```bash
python part2_alarm_clock.py
```

### Example Output:

```
Enter the current time (0-23): 13
Enter number of hours to wait for the alarm: 50
The alarm will go off at: 15:00 hours
```
